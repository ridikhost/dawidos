ISSUE 1: Somehow you get Ubuntu has encountered an critical error but nothing really happened. That will be fixed (i hope). The operating system has not changed from regular Ubuntu but KDE Plasma. I will work on it so it works. Now its just Ubuntu, later it will be GAMING. and also for the americans you pronounce it "DavidOS" even though it says "DawidOS".
ISSUE 2: If it says some snap themes are missing and asks if you want to install them DO NOT! It will break KDE Plasma. If you try and it will somehow works, goodluck to you. and also i removed gnome becuase i felt like it kde plasma is more gaming to me.
To check if the iso is corrupted, check the .md5 checksum of the iso and compare them with the iso.
